Articulate your thoughts clearly using 3 precise steps by Kara Ronin.

Our speech is a reflection of our thinking.

Step 1

Reading

Read books that you don't normally read. Like fiction, non fiction, biography, history, classical literature, literary fiction, business etc.

Read 5-10 pages everyday and recommended during breakfast.

Filling your mind with new vocabulary, sentence structure and new ideas as well.

She recommends reading the book profiles in courage by John F Kennedy.

Step 2

Writing

Writing is one of the best ways to organize your thoughts better. It helps you to identify your thoughts.

You can eliminate the thoughts that you feel that are not important when writing.

Journal writing, formal writing and she recommends to write to atlest one page per day.

You can write about: reflect on the past, fears, conversatiion, challenges, achievements, desires  & goals, disagreements and your future goals, your desires, conversations you want to have with people etc.

You wait for a couple of weeks atleast to start to see improvements in their communication. You basically are retraining your brain.

If you feel more and more clearer in your communication and others start to understand you better.

Step 3

Speaking

This is where you move your thoughts from your mind, in your paper to the other person or the world.

How do you practice speaking?

I want you to choose someone you feel comfortable with and speak with that person for 5 minutes straight about a topic that is important to you like a conversation you recently had with someone, a challenge that you faced, an experience you recently had. 

You can also choose the same topic that you wrote that morning in your journal.

When you do this on a regular basis, it will help you to organize your thoughts, it will help you to master how to communicate them clearly and how to articulate them well.
