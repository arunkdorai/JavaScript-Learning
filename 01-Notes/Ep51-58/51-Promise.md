## ðŸ“˜ **Episode 51 - Promise**

---

### âœ… **What is a Promise?**

A **Promise** in JavaScript represents the **eventual completion or failure** of an asynchronous operation and the value it returns.

It is used to:
- Handle asynchronous tasks (like API calls, file reading, etc.)
- Avoid **callback hell**
- Make code cleaner and more readable

---

### ðŸ”„ **Three States of a Promise**

A promise can be in one of **three states**:

```
+---------------------------+
|      Promise Lifecycle    |
+---------------------------+
| 1. Pending                |
|    - Initial state        |
|                           |
| 2. Fulfilled              |
|    - Operation succeeded  |
|                           |
| 3. Rejected               |
|    - Operation failed     |
+---------------------------+
```

---

### ðŸ§ª **Promise Syntax & Example**

```js
let newPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  let dataReceived = true;

  if (dataReceived) {
    resolve("Data Received");
  } else {
    reject("Data Not Received");
  }
});
```

---

### ðŸ§° **.then(), .catch(), .finally()**

```js
newPromise
  .then((message) => {
    console.log("Success: " + message); // Success: Data Received
    return "Next Success: " + message;
  })
  .then((nextMessage) => {
    console.log(nextMessage); // Next Success: Data Received
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log("Failure: " + error);
  })
  .finally(() => {
    console.log("End"); // Always runs
  });
```

| Method       | Purpose                                            |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `.then()`    | Handles success (fulfilled)                        |
| `.catch()`   | Handles failure (rejected)                         |
| `.finally()` | Runs whether the promise is resolved or rejected   |

---

### ðŸ§± **Callback Hell Example**

**Callback Hell** = nesting multiple callbacks, making the code hard to read and maintain.

```js
function fetchProfile(successCallback, errorCallback) {
  let dataReceived = true;

  if (dataReceived) {
    successCallback("Data Received");
  } else {
    errorCallback("Data Not Received");
  }
}

fetchProfile(
  (message) => {
    console.log(message);
    fetchProfile(
      (nextMessage) => {
        console.log("Next Message: " + nextMessage);
      },
      (nextError) => {
        console.log("Next Error: " + nextError);
      }
    );
  },
  (error) => {
    console.log(error);
  }
);
```

ðŸ˜– **Problem:** As the number of callbacks increases, code becomes like a "Pyramid of Doom".

âœ… **Solution:** Use **Promises** or **Async/Await** to flatten the structure and make it readable.

---

### ðŸ”— **Promise Chaining**

Chaining allows you to **sequence multiple asynchronous operations** in a clean, linear manner.

```js
newPromise
  .then((msg1) => {
    console.log("Step 1:", msg1);
    return "Step 2 from Step 1";
  })
  .then((msg2) => {
    console.log("Step 2:", msg2);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log("Something went wrong:", error);
  })
  .finally(() => {
    console.log("This always runs");
  });
```

---

### ðŸ§  Real-World Analogy

Think of a promise as ordering food at a restaurant:

- **Pending**: You're waiting for your food
- **Fulfilled**: You got your food
- **Rejected**: The chef says theyâ€™re out of your item

---

### ðŸ’¡ Interview Highlights

- **Promises are immutable** once settled
- Promises are better than nested callbacks
- Always use `.catch()` to avoid unhandled rejections
- `finally()` is great for cleanup operations
- Promises are part of ES6

# JavaScript Learning Notes - Episode 51: PROMISE | Secrets REVEALED



**Topics Covered:**

* Overview of Promises in JavaScript
* Three states of a Promise
* Promise example with `resolve`, `reject`, `then`, `catch`, and `finally`
* Callback Hell problem and its illustration
* Promise chaining

---

**ðŸ‘‰ 00:25 - Overview of Promise**

* A Promise in JavaScript is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
* Promises provide a cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations compared to traditional callback-based approaches, especially when dealing with multiple asynchronous tasks.
* They help avoid "callback hell" and improve code readability and maintainability.

**ðŸ‘‰ 01:30 - Three States of a Promise**

* A Promise can be in one of three states:
    1. **Pending:** The initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
    2. **Fulfilled (Resolved):** The operation completed successfully, and the Promise has a resulting value.
    3. **Rejected:** The operation failed, and the Promise has a reason for the failure.

**ðŸ‘‰ 02:10 - Promise Example**

```javascript
let newPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  let dataReceived = true; // Simulating an asynchronous operation

  if (dataReceived) {
    resolve("Data Received"); // Promise is fulfilled
  } else {
    reject("Data Not Received"); // Promise is rejected
  }
});

newPromise
  .then((message) => {
    console.log("Success: " + message);
    return "Next Success: " + message; // Returning a value for chaining
  })
  .then((nextMessage) => {
    console.log(nextMessage);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log("Failure: " + error);
  })
  .finally(() => {
    console.log("End"); // Executes regardless of resolution or rejection
  });
```

* **`new Promise((resolve, reject) => { ... })`:** Creates a new Promise object. The executor function (the function passed as an argument) is executed immediately.
    * **`resolve(value)`:** A function used to fulfill the Promise with a `value`.
    * **`reject(reason)`:** A function used to reject the Promise with a `reason` (usually an error).
* **`.then(onFulfilled, onRejected)`:** Attaches callbacks to handle the fulfillment or rejection of the Promise.
    * `onFulfilled`: Called when the Promise is fulfilled. Receives the resolved `value` as an argument.
    * `onRejected`: Called when the Promise is rejected. Receives the rejection `reason` as an argument.
* **`.catch(onRejected)`:** Attaches a callback to handle only the rejection of the Promise. It's a shorthand for `.then(null, onRejected)`.
* **`.finally(onFinally)`:** Attaches a callback that is called when the Promise is settled (either fulfilled or rejected). It's useful for cleanup operations.

**Promise Chaining:**

* The `.then()` method can return a value (either a regular value or another Promise), which allows you to chain multiple `.then()` calls.
* The returned value from one `.then()` becomes the input to the next `.then()` in the chain.

**ðŸ‘‰ 16:25 - Callback Hell**

* **Callback Hell (Pyramid of Doom):** Occurs when you have multiple nested asynchronous operations using callbacks, leading to deeply nested code that is hard to read and maintain.
* Promises were introduced to solve this problem by providing a more structured way to handle asynchronous code.

```javascript
function fetchProfile(successCallback, errorCallback) {
  let dataReceived = true; // Simulating an asynchronous operation

  if (dataReceived) {
    successCallback("Data Received");
  } else {
    errorCallback("Data Not Received");
  }
}

fetchProfile(
  (message) => {
    console.log(message);

    fetchProfile(
      (nextMessage) => {
        console.log("Next Message: " + nextMessage);

        // ... more nested calls
      },
      (nextError) => {
        console.log("Next Error: " + nextError);
      }
    );
  },
  (error) => {
    console.log(error);
  }
);
```

* The above example demonstrates how nested callbacks can make code difficult to read and manage, especially as the number of asynchronous operations increases.

**ðŸ‘‰ 25:45 - Promise Chaining**

* Promise chaining allows you to sequence asynchronous operations in a more readable and maintainable way.

```javascript
function fetchProfilePromise(dataReceived) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    if (dataReceived) {
      resolve("Data Received (Promise)");
    } else {
      reject("Data Not Received (Promise)");
    }
  });
}

fetchProfilePromise(true)
  .then((message) => {
    console.log(message);
    return fetchProfilePromise(true); // Return another Promise
  })
  .then((nextMessage) => {
    console.log("Next Message: " + nextMessage);
    // ... more Promise operations
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log(error);
  });
```

* In the Promise chaining example, the code is more linear and easier to follow compared to the callback hell example.
* Each `.then()` returns a Promise, which allows the next `.then()` to wait for the completion of the previous asynchronous operation.

**Key Benefits of Promises:**

* **Readability:** Provides a more readable and structured way to handle asynchronous code.
* **Error Handling:** Centralized error handling using `.catch()`.
* **Chaining:** Allows you to sequence asynchronous operations.
* **Avoid Callback Hell:** Reduces nesting and improves code maintainability.
