**What is Programming Language**

* A programming language is a structured set of rules and syntax that allows humans to communicate instructions to a computer.
* It provides a way to create software, perform calculations, automate tasks, and solve problems.
* Examples of programming languages include JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, etc.

---

**What is Variable**

* Variables are containers used to store and manage data within a program.
* They act as symbolic names that hold values of different types (e.g., numbers, text, booleans, objects).
* Using variables makes it easier to refer to and manipulate data throughout your code.

---

**How to Declare a Variable**

* To create (declare) a variable in JavaScript, you typically follow this structure:
  ```javascript
  keyword variableName = value;
  ```
  * **keyword:** This is a reserved word in JavaScript used to indicate the type of variable declaration (e.g., `var`, `let`, `const`).
  * **variableName:** This is the identifier you choose for your variable. It should be descriptive and follow JavaScript naming conventions (e.g., start with a letter, underscore `_`, or dollar sign `$`, and cannot contain spaces).
  * **=:** The assignment operator, used to assign a value to the variable.
  * **value:** The data you want to store in the variable (e.g., `"Hello"`, `10`, `true`).
  * **; (optional but recommended):** A semicolon typically marks the end of a statement in JavaScript. While often optional due to automatic semicolon insertion, it's good practice to include them for clarity and to avoid potential issues.

**üïò 03:00 - Declare variable with var, let & const**

JavaScript provides three keywords for declaring variables, each with different characteristics: `var`, `let`, and `const`.

**1. `var` (Older way of declaring variables)**

* **Function Scoped:** Variables declared with `var` have function scope. This means they are accessible throughout the entire function in which they are declared (or globally if declared outside any function).
* **Hoisting:** `var` declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope, meaning you can technically use a `var` variable before its declaration in the code (though it will have a value of `undefined`).
* **Redeclaration Allowed:** You can redeclare a variable with the same name using `var` within the same scope (though this is generally discouraged as it can lead to confusion).

   ```javascript
   var user1 = "Front End Development";
   var user1 = "Another Value"; // Redeclaration is allowed (but not recommended)
   ```

**2. `let` (Introduced in ES6/ES2015)**

* **Block Scoped:** Variables declared with `let` have block scope. This means they are only accessible within the block of code (defined by curly braces `{}`) where they are declared.
* **No Hoisting (Temporal Dead Zone):** `let` declarations are hoisted, but they are not initialized. Trying to access a `let` variable before its declaration within its scope will result in a `ReferenceError` (it's in the "temporal dead zone").
* **Redeclaration Not Allowed:** You cannot redeclare a variable with the same name using `let` within the same scope.

   ```javascript
   let email = "abc@gmail.com";
   // let email = "[email address removed]"; // This would cause a SyntaxError
   email = "[email address removed]"; // Reassignment of value is allowed
   ```

**3. `const` (Introduced in ES6/ES2015)**

* **Block Scoped:** Similar to `let`, `const` variables have block scope.
* **No Hoisting (Temporal Dead Zone):** Also similar to `let`, `const` variables are hoisted but not initialized, leading to a temporal dead zone.
* **No Redeclaration:** You cannot redeclare a variable with the same name using `const` within the same scope.
* **Immutable (for primitive types):** Once a `const` variable is assigned a value, you cannot reassign a new value to it. **However**, if a `const` variable holds an object or an array, the *contents* of the object or array can still be modified; it's the binding of the variable to that specific object or array that cannot be changed.
* **Initialization Required:** You must assign a value to a `const` variable when you declare it.

   ```javascript
   const age = 25;
   // age = 26; // This would cause a TypeError (assignment to constant variable)
   // const age; // This would cause a SyntaxError (missing initializer)

   const myObject = { key: "value" };
   myObject.key = "newValue"; // This is allowed (modifying object property)
   // myObject = { anotherKey: "anotherValue" }; // This is not allowed (reassigning the variable)
   ```

**Code Example from the Episode:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Variables in JavaScript</h1>

    <script>
      //Variable Declaration

      // keyword variable_name = value ;
      var user1 = "Front End Development";
      let email = "abc@gmail.com";
      const age = 25;

      console.log(user1);
      console.log(email);
      console.log(age); // Added console.log for 'age'
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

**Best Practices:**

* It is generally recommended to use `let` for variables whose values might change and `const` for variables whose values should remain constant.
* Avoid using `var` in modern JavaScript development due to its function scoping and potential for unintended side effects. `let` and `const` provide more predictable and manageable scope.

### **Topics Covered:**  
- What is a programming language?  
- What are variables?  
- How to declare variables in JavaScript  
- Difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`  

---

### **üïò 00:15 - What is a Programming Language?**  
A **programming language** is a set of rules that tells a **computer** what to do. It allows people to write instructions that a computer can understand and execute.  

‚úÖ **Uses of Programming Languages:**  
- Building **software and applications**  
- Performing **mathematical operations**  
- **Automating** tasks  
- **Solving problems** efficiently  

‚úÖ **Examples of Programming Languages:**  
- **JavaScript** (Web Development)  
- **Python** (Machine Learning, AI, Web)  
- **Java** (Android Apps, Backend Development)  

---

### **üïò 00:55 - What is a Variable?**  
- A **variable** is a container for storing data.  
- Variables **help manage and reuse values** in a program.  
- A variable can store different types of values, such as:  
  - **Numbers** ‚Üí `let age = 25;`  
  - **Text (Strings)** ‚Üí `let name = "Alice";`  
  - **Objects/Arrays** ‚Üí `let user = { name: "John", age: 30 };`  

---

### **üïò 02:00 - How to Declare Variables in JavaScript**  
In JavaScript, you create a variable using **keywords** like `var`, `let`, or `const`.  

**Syntax:**  
```javascript
// keyword variableName = value;
let name = "John";
```

‚úÖ **Rules for Naming Variables:**  
‚úî Should start with a **letter**, `_`, or `$`.  
‚úî Can contain **letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs**.  
‚úî Case-sensitive (`user` and `User` are different).  
‚ùå Cannot use **reserved keywords** (e.g., `let`, `const`, `function`).  

---

### **üïò 03:00 - Declare Variable with `var`, `let`, & `const`**  
#### **üîπ `var` (Old Way)**
- Used before ES6 (2015).  
- **Function-scoped** (visible inside a function).  
- Allows **re-declaration** within the same scope.  

Example:  
```javascript
var user1 = "Front End Development";
console.log(user1);
var user1 = "Back End Development"; // ‚úÖ Allowed
console.log(user1);
```
üö® **Issues with `var`:**  
- Can be **redeclared**, leading to unexpected behavior.  
- **Not block-scoped**, meaning it can be accessed outside `{}`.  

---

#### **üîπ `let` (Modern and Preferred)**
- Introduced in **ES6** (2015).  
- **Block-scoped** (only accessible inside `{}`).  
- Can be updated, but **cannot be re-declared in the same scope**.  

Example:  
```javascript
let email = "abc@gmail.com";
console.log(email);
email = "xyz@gmail.com"; // ‚úÖ Allowed (Updating value)
console.log(email);

// let email = "new@gmail.com"; ‚ùå Error (Cannot redeclare)
```

‚úÖ **Use `let` when you need to update a value**.  

---

#### **üîπ `const` (Immutable Variables)**
- Introduced in **ES6**.  
- **Block-scoped** like `let`.  
- **Cannot be reassigned** after initialization.  

Example:  
```javascript
const age = 25;
console.log(age);

// age = 30; ‚ùå Error (Cannot change a `const` variable)
```
‚úÖ **Use `const` for values that should never change** (e.g., API keys, configuration settings).  

---

### **üìù Key Differences:**
| Feature      | `var` | `let` | `const` |
|-------------|------|------|--------|
| Scope | Function-scoped | Block-scoped | Block-scoped |
| Re-declaration | ‚úÖ Allowed | ‚ùå Not Allowed | ‚ùå Not Allowed |
| Value Change | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |

---

### **Full Code Example from the Video:**  
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>JavaScript Variables</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Variables in JavaScript</h1>

    <script>
      // Variable Declaration
      var user1 = "Front End Development";  // Function-scoped
      let email = "abc@gmail.com";  // Block-scoped, can be updated
      const age = 25;  // Block-scoped, cannot be changed

      console.log(user1);
      console.log(email);
      console.log(age);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
‚úÖ **Features in this example:**  
- Demonstrates `var`, `let`, and `const` usage.  
- Logs variables to the **Console**.  
- Shows how **values are stored and accessed**.  

---

### **Summary from Episode 4:**  
- **Variables** store and manage data in JavaScript.  
- Use `var` (old way), `let` (preferred), or `const` (for fixed values).  
- **`var` is function-scoped**, while **`let` and `const` are block-scoped**.  
- **Use `let` for values that change** and **`const` for fixed values**.  

---

### **Next Steps:**  
- Practice declaring variables using `var`, `let`, and `const`.  
- Try **changing** values and checking for errors in the **browser console**.  
- Continue with **Episode 5** and document notes similarly.
