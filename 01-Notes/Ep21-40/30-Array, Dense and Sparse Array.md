## 🧱 **What is an Array?**

- An **array** is a data structure used to **store multiple values** in a single variable.
- Items in the array are accessed using **indexes** starting from `0`.
- JavaScript arrays can store **homogeneous** (same type) and **heterogeneous** (different types) data.

```javascript
let sample = [1, "two", true, null, undefined, { id: 1 }];
```

✅ Arrays are **dynamic** — you can grow or shrink them by adding or removing elements.

## 🔧 **Creating Arrays**

### 1. **Array Literal (Most Common)**
```javascript
let flavors = ["vanilla", "butterscotch", "lavender", "chocolate"];

console.log(flavors[0]); // vanilla
console.log(flavors.length); // 4
```

### 2. **Array Constructor**
```javascript
let newArray = new Array();
newArray[0] = "First";
newArray[1] = "Second";

console.log(newArray); // ["First", "Second"]
console.log(newArray.length); // 2
```

## ✨ **Features of Arrays**

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Indexed | Elements are accessed by index (starting from 0) |
| Dynamic | Automatically adjusts size |
| Heterogeneous | Can contain different data types |
| Mutable | Elements can be updated or removed |
| Objects | Arrays are technically special kinds of objects |

## 🧠 **Dense vs Sparse Arrays**

### 🔹 Dense Array
- Contains elements at **every index** (no gaps)
- Stored in **contiguous memory locations**

```javascript
let denseArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(denseArray); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

📌 Internally: Like  
```
Index:    0   1   2   3   4  
Memory: 1004 1008 1012 1016 1020
```

---

### 🔸 Sparse Array
- **Missing elements** in between (i.e., indexes without values)
- Internally stored as **key-value pairs** (like a hash map)

```javascript
let sparseArray = [10, 20, , 40, , 60];
console.log(sparseArray); // [10, 20, <1 empty item>, 40, <1 empty item>, 60]
```

📌 Note: These gaps are **undefined** but not explicitly set

## 📝 Summary

| Concept | Key Point |
|--------|-----------|
| Array | Collection of values stored in indexed format |
| Heterogeneous | Can mix numbers, strings, booleans, etc. |
| Literal vs Constructor | Two ways to create arrays |
| Dense Array | No missing indexes |
| Sparse Array | Has gaps (missing indexes) |

**🕘 00:15 - What is Array**

* In JavaScript, an **array** is an ordered collection of items (elements) stored in a single variable.
* Arrays are used to represent lists of data.
* Each element in an array has an associated index, which is a numerical position starting from 0.

**Example:**

```javascript
let flavors = ["vanilla", "butterscotch", "lavender", "chocolate"];
```

In this array, "vanilla" is at index 0, "butterscotch" at index 1, and so on.

**🕘 01:10 - How array elements are managed (conceptually)**

* JavaScript arrays, unlike arrays in some other languages, are dynamic and can grow or shrink as needed.
* Conceptually, the JavaScript engine manages the storage of array elements. For **dense arrays** (explained later), elements are stored in contiguous memory locations, allowing for efficient access based on the index.
* However, JavaScript arrays are more like lists or hash tables under the hood, especially when they become sparse or when elements are added/removed frequently. The engine optimizes for performance based on how the array is used.

**Accessing Elements:**

You can access individual elements of an array using their index in square brackets `[]`.

```javascript
console.log(flavors[0]); // Output: vanilla
console.log(flavors[1]); // Output: butterscotch
console.log(flavors[2]); // Output: lavender
```

**`length` Property:**

The `length` property of an array returns the number of elements in the array.

```javascript
console.log(flavors.length); // Output: 4
```

You can also find the index of the last element by subtracting 1 from the `length`.

```javascript
let lastIndex = flavors.length - 1;
console.log(lastIndex, flavors[lastIndex]); // Output: 3 chocolate
```

**Heterogeneous Data:**

JavaScript arrays can store elements of different data types.

```javascript
let sample = [1, "two", true, null, undefined, { id: 1 }];
console.log(sample); // Output: [ 1, 'two', true, null, undefined, { id: 1 } ]
```

**🕘 04:07 - Understanding Features in Array**

* **Data Structure:** Arrays are a fundamental data structure for storing collections.
* **Heterogeneous:** Can hold various data types within the same array.
* **Homogeneous (can be):** Can also hold elements of the same data type.
* **Indexed:** Elements are accessed using zero-based numerical indices.
* **Dynamic Size:** Arrays can grow or shrink as elements are added or removed.

**🕘 05:50 - Types to create Array**

There are two primary ways to create arrays in JavaScript:

1. **Array Literal:** Using square brackets `[]` with comma-separated elements.
2. **Array Constructor:** Using the `new Array()` constructor.

**🕘 06:00 - Array Constructor**

You can create an empty array using `new Array()`:

```javascript
let newArray = new Array();
console.log(newArray); // Output: []
console.log(newArray.length); // Output: 0
```

You can then add elements to the array by assigning values to specific indices:

```javascript
newArray[0] = "First";
newArray[1] = "Second";
newArray[2] = "Third";
newArray[3] = "Fourth";

console.log(newArray); // Output: [ 'First', 'Second', 'Third', 'Fourth' ]
console.log(newArray.length); // Output: 4
```

You can also create an array with a specified initial length using the constructor:

```javascript
let anotherArray = new Array(5); // Creates an array with a length of 5 (empty slots)
console.log(anotherArray); // Output: [ <5 empty items> ]
console.log(anotherArray.length); // Output: 5
```

**Note:** While the `Array` constructor exists, using **array literals `[]` is generally the preferred and more concise way** to create arrays in JavaScript.

**🕘 08:00 - Overview of Dense & Sparse Array**

JavaScript arrays can be either **dense** or **sparse**, depending on how their elements are indexed.

* **Dense Array:** A dense array has its elements stored contiguously in memory, starting from index 0 up to `length - 1`, without any gaps or missing indices.

* **Sparse Array:** A sparse array, on the other hand, has gaps in its indices. This means there are indices within the array's `length` that do not have an assigned value. Sparse arrays are often implemented using a more hash table-like structure to store only the key-value pairs for the existing elements, which can be more memory-efficient when there are many missing elements.

**🕘 08:27 - Dense Array example**

```javascript
let denseArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; // Contiguous Memory Location (conceptually)
console.log(denseArray); // Output: [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
console.log(denseArray.length); // Output: 5
```

In a dense array, the elements are stored in order, and there are no unassigned indices between the first element (index 0) and the last element (index `length - 1`). Conceptually, if the first element is at a certain memory address, the subsequent elements are located at the next available contiguous memory locations (taking into account the size of each element).

**Formula (Conceptual):**

For a dense array, you can think of accessing an element at a specific index using a formula (though the JavaScript engine handles this internally):

`memoryAddress = baseAddress + (index * sizeOfElement)`

where:
* `baseAddress` is the starting memory address of the array.
* `index` is the index of the element you want to access.
* `sizeOfElement` is the amount of memory each element occupies.

**🕘 10:43 - Sparse Array example**

```javascript
let sparseArray = [10, 20, , 40, , 60]; // Hash Table or Hash Map (conceptually)
console.log(sparseArray); // Output: [ 10, 20, <1 empty item>, 40, <1 empty item>, 60 ]
console.log(sparseArray.length); // Output: 6
```

In this sparse array:

* There are values at indices 0, 1, 3, and 5.
* Indices 2 and 4 do not have assigned values, creating "empty slots".
* The `length` property is 6, even though there are only four actual values.

**How Sparse Arrays are Managed (Conceptually):**

Sparse arrays are not stored in contiguous memory in the same way as dense arrays. Instead, the JavaScript engine might use a hash table or a similar data structure where only the indices that have assigned values are stored as keys, along with their corresponding values. This is more efficient in terms of memory usage when there are large gaps in the array indices.

**Creating Sparse Arrays:**

You can create sparse arrays in several ways:

* By leaving empty slots in array literals (using extra commas).
* By assigning values to indices that are far beyond the current length of the array.

```javascript
let anotherSparse = [];
anotherSparse[10] = "value at index 10";
console.log(anotherSparse); // Output: [ <10 empty items>, 'value at index 10' ]
console.log(anotherSparse.length); // Output: 11
```

**Important Considerations for Sparse Arrays:**

* Operations on sparse arrays might be less performant than on dense arrays in some cases, as the JavaScript engine needs to check for the existence of elements at specific indices.
* Be mindful when iterating over sparse arrays, as standard loop constructs like `for` loops will still iterate up to the `length`, and you might encounter `undefined` for the empty slots. Methods like `forEach` will skip the empty slots.
