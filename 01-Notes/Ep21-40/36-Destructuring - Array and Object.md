## 🔍 **What is Destructuring?**

Destructuring lets you **extract values** from arrays or objects and assign them to variables in a clean and concise way.  
Think of it as **unpacking values** into variables.

---

## 🔢 **Array Destructuring**

### ✅ Basic Example:

```javascript
let arr = [10, 20, 30, 40];
let [a, b, c, d] = arr;

console.log(a, b, c, d); // ➝ 10 20 30 40
```

### ✅ Skipping Elements:

```javascript
let arr1 = [15, 25, 35, 45];
let [x, , , z] = arr1;

console.log(x, z); // ➝ 15 45
```

### ✅ Rest Operator in Destructuring:

```javascript
let arr2 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];
let [a1, a2, a3, ...a4] = arr2;

console.log(a1, a2, a3); // ➝ 1 2 3
console.log(a4);         // ➝ [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

---

## 🧩 **Nested Array Destructuring**

```javascript
let nestArr = [1, 2, 3, 4, [10, 20, [30, 40]]];

let [b1, b2, b3, b4, [c1, c2, [d1, d2]]] = nestArr;

console.log(b4); // ➝ 4
console.log(d2); // ➝ 40
```

---

## 🧱 **Object Destructuring**

```javascript
let obj = {
    id: 1,
    name1: "Arun"
};

let { id, name1 } = obj;
console.log(id, name1); // ➝ 1 Arun
```

---

## 🏗️ **Nested Object Destructuring**

```javascript
let nestObj = {
    id: 1,
    name1: "Arun",
    bankDetails: {
        accName: "Kumar",
        accNo: 123456,
        branch: "xyz"
    }
};

let { id, name1, bankDetails: { accName, accNo, branch } } = nestObj;

console.log(id, name1, accName, accNo, branch);
// ➝ 1 Arun Kumar 123456 xyz
```

| Nested Object           | `let { details: { id } } = obj;`           | Access deep nested property                        |

# JavaScript Learning Notes - Episode 36: Destructuring - Array & Object in Javascript



**Topics Covered:**

* Destructuring Overview
* Array Destructuring (basic, skipping elements, rest operator)
* Nested Array Destructuring
* Object Destructuring (basic, renaming)
* Nested Object Destructuring

---

**🕘 00:05 - Destructuring Overview**

* **Destructuring** is an ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) feature that allows you to extract values from arrays or properties from objects and assign them to distinct variables in a concise and readable way.
* It provides a convenient syntax to unpack values from data structures.

---

**🕘 00:33 - Array Destructuring**

* Array destructuring allows you to unpack values from an array into separate variables. The variables are assigned based on their position in the array.

```javascript
let arr = [10, 20, 30, 40];

let [a, b, c, d] = arr;

console.log(a, b, c, d); // Output: 10 20 30 40
```

* Here, the first element of `arr` (10) is assigned to `a`, the second (20) to `b`, and so on.

* **Skipping Elements:** You can skip elements in the array during destructuring by leaving the corresponding position empty in the variable declaration.

```javascript
let arr1 = [15, 25, 35, 45];

let [x, , , z] = arr1;

console.log(x, z); // Output: 15 45 (25 and 35 are skipped)
```

* Here, `x` gets the first element (15), the next two elements are skipped, and `z` gets the fourth element (45).

**🕘 03:13 - Rest Operator Example (with Array Destructuring)**

* You can use the rest operator (`...`) in array destructuring to collect the remaining elements of an array into a new array. The rest variable must be the last one in the destructuring assignment.

```javascript
let arr2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15];

let [a1, a2, a3, ...a4] = arr2; // ...a4 is the rest operator

console.log(a1, a2, a3, a4);
// Output: 1 2 3 [ 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 ]
```

* `a1` gets 1, `a2` gets 2, `a3` gets 3, and `a4` becomes a new array containing all the remaining elements of `arr2`.

**🕘 05:11 - Nested Array Destructuring**

* If an array contains other arrays as elements, you can use nested destructuring to extract values from these inner arrays.

```javascript
let nestArr = [1, 2, 3, 4, [10, 20, [30, 40]]];

let [b1, b2, b3, b4, [c1, c2, [d1, d2]]] = nestArr;

console.log(b4, d2); // Output: 4 40
```

* To access `d2` (which is inside a nested array), the destructuring pattern mirrors the structure of the nested array.
    * `b1` gets 1, `b2` gets 2, `b3` gets 3, `b4` gets 4.
    * The fifth element of `nestArr` is itself an array `[10, 20, [30, 40]]`. This is destructured as `[c1, c2, [d1, d2]]`.
    * `c1` gets 10, `c2` gets 20, and the third element `[30, 40]` is further destructured as `[d1, d2]`, where `d1` gets 30 and `d2` gets 40.

**🕘 07:45 - Object Destructuring**

* Object destructuring allows you to extract values from an object's properties and assign them to variables using the property names as the keys in the destructuring pattern.

```javascript
let obj = {
  id: 1,
  name1: "Arun"
};

let { id, name1 } = obj; // Variable names must match the property names

console.log(id, name1); // Output: 1 Arun
```

* Here, the `id` property's value (1) is assigned to the `id` variable, and the `name1` property's value ("Arun") is assigned to the `name1` variable. The order of variables in the destructuring pattern does not matter, as long as the names match the object's keys.

* **Renaming Variables during Destructuring:** You can assign object property values to new variable names using the syntax `propertyName: newVariableName`.

```javascript
let person = {
  firstName: "John",
  age: 30
};

let { firstName: fName, age: personAge } = person;

console.log(fName, personAge); // Output: John 30
```

* Here, the value of `firstName` is assigned to `fName`, and the value of `age` is assigned to `personAge`.

**🕘 11:55 - Nested Object Destructuring**

* You can also destructure properties from nested objects by mirroring the nested structure in your destructuring pattern.

```javascript
let nestObj = {
  id: 1,
  name1: "Arun",
  bankDetails: {
    accName: "Kumar",
    accNo: 123456,
    branch: "xyz"
  }
};

let { id, name1, bankDetails: { accName, accNo, branch } } = nestObj;

console.log(id, name1, accName, accNo, branch); // Output: 1 Arun Kumar 123456 xyz
```

* To access properties within the `bankDetails` nested object, you specify `bankDetails: { accName, accNo, branch }`. This tells JavaScript to look for the `bankDetails` property in `nestObj`, and then destructure its properties `accName`, `accNo`, and `branch` into corresponding variables.

**Key Benefits of Destructuring:**

* **Conciseness:** Makes code shorter and easier to read.
* **Readability:** Clearly shows which values from an array or object are being extracted.
* **Convenience:** Simplifies accessing specific parts of data structures, especially nested ones.
* **Improves Code Clarity:** By naming the variables according to the properties or elements you need, the code becomes more self-documenting.
