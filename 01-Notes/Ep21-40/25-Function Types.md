In JavaScript, there are different types of functions you can use. 

Named functions are functions that have a name. For example, function greet() {} is a named function. You can call this function using its name wherever you need it.

Anonymous functions donâ€™t have a name. They are usually stored in a variable, like const greet = function() {}. Even though they don't have a name, you can still use them by calling the variable they are stored in.

Arrow functions are a shorter way to write functions, introduced in ES6. They donâ€™t have a name and are often used for simple tasks. An example of an arrow function is const greet = () = {}. They make the code look cleaner and easier to read.
