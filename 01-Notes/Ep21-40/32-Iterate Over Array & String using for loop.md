## 🔁 **What is Iteration?**

**Iteration** means going through each item in a collection (like an array or string) **one by one** to perform some operation.

This is a foundational concept in programming, especially when working with data collections.

---

## 📦 **Iterating Over an Array (Using `for` loop)**

```javascript
let arr = [10, 20, 30, 40];

for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    console.log(arr[i]);
}
```

### 🧠 How it works:
- `i = 0`: start from the first index.
- `i < arr.length`: continue until the last item.
- `arr[i]`: access current element by index.

✅ Output:
```
10
20
30
40
```

## 🔤 **Iterating Over a String (Using `for` loop)**

```javascript
let str = "Javascript";

for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    console.log(str[i]);
}
```

### 🧠 Explanation:
- A string is a sequence of characters.
- Each character can be accessed like an array element using its index.

✅ Output:
```
J
a
v
a
s
c
r
i
p
t
```

## 📝 **Summary Table**

| Type   | Structure | Access Example     | Loop Used  |
|--------|-----------|--------------------|------------|
| Array  | `[10, 20]`| `arr[i]`           | `for` loop |
| String | `"Hello"` | `str[i]`           | `for` loop |

# JavaScript Learning Notes - Episode 32: Iterate Over Array & String using for loop in Javascript



**Topics Covered:**

* Iterate Objects Overview (misleading, should be Iterate Collections)
* What is Iteration
* Iterate Array - `for` Loop
* Iterate String - `for` Loop

**🕘 00:15 - Iterate Objects Overview (Correction: Iterate Collections)**

* The topic of iteration generally refers to the process of sequentially accessing each element within a collection of items. In JavaScript, this primarily applies to arrays and strings (which can be treated as sequences of characters). While you can also iterate over the properties of an object, the methods and approaches differ slightly and might be covered in later episodes. This episode focuses on arrays and strings.

**🕘 00:28 - What is Iteration**

* **Iteration** is the act of repeating a process or a set of instructions for each item in a collection (like an array) or a sequence (like a string).
* It allows you to perform the same operation or a related operation on every element of the data structure.

**Example:** Imagine you have a list of tasks. Iteration would involve going through each task in the list one by one to check if it's completed.

**🕘 01:02 - Iterate Array - `for` Loop**

The `for` loop is a fundamental control flow statement in JavaScript used for iterating over arrays (and other iterable objects).

**Syntax:**

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
  // Code to be executed for each element of the array
  // You can access the current element using array[i]
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`let i = 0;` (Initialization):** A counter variable `i` is initialized to 0. This variable typically represents the index of the array.
2. **`i < array.length;` (Condition):** The loop continues to execute as long as the value of `i` is less than the total number of elements in the array (obtained using the `length` property).
3. **`i++` (Increment):** After each iteration of the loop, the value of `i` is incremented by 1, moving to the next index in the array.
4. **`// Code to be executed...` (Loop Body):** The code inside the curly braces is executed for each value of `i` that satisfies the condition. Inside the loop, `array[i]` is used to access the element at the current index `i`.

**Example from the code:**

```javascript
let arr = [10, 20, 30, 40];

for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  console.log(arr[i]);
}
/*
Output:
10
20
30
40
*/
```

* The loop starts with `i = 0`. `arr.length` is 4.
* **Iteration 1:** `i` is 0, `0 < 4` is true, `console.log(arr[0])` (logs 10), `i` becomes 1.
* **Iteration 2:** `i` is 1, `1 < 4` is true, `console.log(arr[1])` (logs 20), `i` becomes 2.
* **Iteration 3:** `i` is 2, `2 < 4` is true, `console.log(arr[2])` (logs 30), `i` becomes 3.
* **Iteration 4:** `i` is 3, `3 < 4` is true, `console.log(arr[3])` (logs 40), `i` becomes 4.
* Now, `i` is 4, `4 < 4` is false, so the loop terminates.

**Other ways to iterate over arrays (brief mention, might be covered later):**

* `for...of` loop (for iterating over values)
* `forEach` method (for executing a callback function for each element)
* `for...in` loop (generally not recommended for arrays as it iterates over indices as strings and can include inherited properties)

**🕘 05:20 - Iterate String - `for` Loop**

Strings in JavaScript can also be treated as sequences of characters, and you can use a `for` loop to iterate over each character in the string.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {
  // Code to be executed for each character of the string
  // You can access the current character using string[i]
}
```

**Explanation:**

The logic is very similar to iterating over an array. The `length` property of a string returns the number of characters in the string, and you can access the character at a specific index using square bracket notation `string[i]`.

**Example from the code:**

```javascript
let str = "Javascript";

for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
  console.log(str[i]);
}
/*
Output:
J
a
v
a
s
c
r
i
p
t
*/
```

* The loop starts with `i = 0`. `str.length` is 10.
* In each iteration, the character at the current index `i` of the `str` string is accessed using `str[i]` and printed to the console.
* The loop continues until all characters in the string have been processed.

**Other ways to iterate over strings (brief mention, might be covered later):**

* `for...of` loop (for iterating over character values)

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Iteration** is essential for processing collections of data.
* The `for` loop provides a structured way to iterate over arrays and strings using an index.
* You access array elements using `array[index]` and string characters using `string[index]`.
* The loop continues as long as the index is less than the `length` of the array or string.
