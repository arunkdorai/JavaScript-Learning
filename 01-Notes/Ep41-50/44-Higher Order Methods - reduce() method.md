## üîÑ Why `reduce()`?

- Instead of manually looping through arrays (e.g., to sum values), `reduce()` provides a **cleaner and functional approach**.
- It is used to **combine all elements** of an array into a **single value** (e.g., total, product, object, string, etc.).

---

## ‚úÖ Traditional `for` Loop Example:
```javascript
let arr = [10, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let totalVal = 0;

for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  totalVal = totalVal + arr[i];
}

console.log(totalVal); // 24
```

---

## ‚úÖ Using `reduce()`:
```javascript
let totalVal1 = arr.reduce((acc, cElement, index, array) => {
  return acc + cElement;
}, 0);

console.log(totalVal1); // 24
```

### üîç How it Works Internally:
- `acc` = accumulator (keeps running total)
- `cElement` = current item being processed

| Iteration | acc | cElement | Result |
|-----------|-----|----------|--------|
| 1         | 0   | 10       | 10     |
| 2         | 10  | 2        | 12     |
| 3         | 12  | 3        | 15     |
| 4         | 15  | 4        | 19     |
| 5         | 19  | 5        | 24     |

## üíº Real-Life Use Case: Total Salary of Employees

```javascript
let employees = [
  { eName: "Xyz", salary: 1000 },
  { eName: "Abc", salary: 18000 },
  { eName: "Billy", salary: 20000 },
  { eName: "Carl", salary: 25000 },
];

let calcTotalSalary = employees.reduce((acc, cElement) => {
  return acc + cElement.salary;
}, 0);

console.log(calcTotalSalary); // 64000
```

## üîÅ Method Summary

| Method   | Purpose                                 | Return         |
|----------|------------------------------------------|----------------|
| `reduce` | Reduces array to a single value (sum, etc.) | Single value   |

## ‚ú® Benefits of `reduce()`:
- Clean, functional-style code
- Chainable with other methods (`filter`, `map`)
- Ideal for totals, averages, grouping, transformations

# JavaScript Learning Notes - Episode 44: Higher Order Methods - reduce() method in Javascript



**Topics Covered:**

* Why the `reduce()` method is useful for aggregation
* Summing array elements using a `for` loop (traditional approach)
* `reduce()` method example (summing array elements)
* Process of each iteration in the `reduce()` method (accumulator and current element)
* Example 2 - Using `reduce()` to calculate the total salary of employees

**üëâ 00:10 - Why `reduce()` method?**

* The `reduce()` method is a powerful higher-order array method in JavaScript used to **reduce** an array to a single value.
* It executes a provided callback function on each element of the array, passing in the return value from the previous callback execution.
* It's particularly useful for performing calculations across all elements of an array, such as finding the sum, product, maximum, minimum, or any other form of aggregation.
* It abstracts away the manual iteration and state management often required with traditional loops for such tasks, leading to more concise and readable code.

**üëâ 00:46 - Sum of Array Elements using `for` loop (Traditional Approach)**

* The tutorial illustrates how to find the sum of elements in an array using a traditional `for` loop:

```javascript
let arr = [10, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let totalVal = 0;

for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  totalVal = totalVal + arr[i];
}

console.log(totalVal); // Output: 24
```

* This approach requires initializing a variable (`totalVal`) to store the accumulated sum and then iterating through the array, adding each element to the accumulator.

**üëâ 04:10 - `reduce()` method example (Summing Array Elements)**

* The `reduce()` method provides a more concise way to achieve the same result:

```javascript
let arr = [10, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let totalVal1 = arr.reduce((acc, cElement, index, array) => {
  return acc + cElement;
}, 0);

console.log(totalVal1); // Output: 24
```

**Syntax of `reduce()`:**

```javascript
array.reduce(callback(accumulator, currentValue, currentIndex, array), initialValue);
```

* **`callback`:** A function to execute on each element in the array (except for the first element if `initialValue` is not provided). It takes four arguments:
    * `accumulator` (`acc`): The accumulated value previously returned in the last invocation of the callback, or `initialValue`, if supplied.
    * `currentValue` (`cElement`): The current element being processed in the array.
    * `currentIndex` (`index` - optional): The index of the current element being processed.
    * `array` (`array` - optional): The array `reduce()` was called upon.
* **`initialValue` (optional):** A value to use as the first argument to the first call of the `callback`. If no `initialValue` is supplied, the first element in the array will be used as the initial `accumulator` and the `callback` will not be executed on that first element.

**üëâ 06:35 - Process of each iteration in `reduce()` method (with `initialValue`)**

* In the example `arr.reduce((acc, cElement) => acc + cElement, 0)`, the `initialValue` is `0`.

1. **1st Iteration:**
   * `acc` (accumulator) is `0` (the `initialValue`).
   * `cElement` (current element) is `10` (the first element of `arr`).
   * The callback returns `0 + 10 = 10`. This `10` becomes the `acc` for the next iteration.

2. **2nd Iteration:**
   * `acc` is `10` (the result from the previous iteration).
   * `cElement` is `2`.
   * The callback returns `10 + 2 = 12`.

3. **3rd Iteration:**
   * `acc` is `12`.
   * `cElement` is `3`.
   * The callback returns `12 + 3 = 15`.

4. **4th Iteration:**
   * `acc` is `15`.
   * `cElement` is `4`.
   * The callback returns `15 + 4 = 19`.

5. **5th Iteration:**
   * `acc` is `19`.
   * `cElement` is `5`.
   * The callback returns `19 + 5 = 24`.

* After the last element is processed, `reduce()` returns the final accumulated value, which is `24`.

**üëâ 08:13 - Example 2 - Adding salary of employees**

* `reduce()` can also be used with arrays of objects to perform aggregations based on object properties:

```javascript
let employees = [
  { eName: "Xyz", salary: 1000 },
  { eName: "Abc", salary: 18000 },
  { eName: "Billy", salary: 20000 },
  { eName: "Carl", salary: 25000 },
];

let calcTotalSalary = employees.reduce((acc, cElement) => {
  return acc + cElement.salary;
}, 0);

console.log(calcTotalSalary); // Output: 64000
```

* In this example, `reduce()` iterates through the `employees` array. The `initialValue` for the `acc` (accumulator) is `0`. In each iteration, the `salary` property of the `cElement` (current employee object) is added to the `acc`. The final result is the total salary of all employees.

**Key Benefits of `reduce()`:**

* **Conciseness:** Simplifies aggregation logic compared to traditional loops.
* **Readability:** Makes the intent of the code clearer (reducing an array to a single value).
* **Flexibility:** Can be used for various aggregation tasks beyond just summing numbers (e.g., finding min/max, concatenating strings, creating objects).
* **Functional Style:** Encourages a more functional programming style.

**Important Note:** When using `reduce()` on an empty array without an `initialValue`, it will throw a `TypeError`. It's generally good practice to provide an `initialValue` to avoid this issue and to ensure predictable behavior.
