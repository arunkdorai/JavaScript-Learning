## 🔃 `sort()` Method with Callback

### ⚠️ Without Callback:
- `sort()` treats values as **strings** using **ASCII values**.
- E.g., `[10, 2, 100]` becomes `[10, 100, 2]` (because "1" < "2").

### ✅ With Callback:
You can provide a function to define the **sorting logic**.

#### 🔼 Ascending Order:
```javascript
array.sort((a, b) => a - b);
```
- If **a > b** → **positive** → swap.
- If **a < b** → **negative** → keep as is.

#### 🔽 Descending Order:
```javascript
array.sort((a, b) => b - a);
```
- If **b > a** → **positive** → swap.
- This sorts from **largest to smallest**.

#### 🧠 Special Case:
Sorting mixed types (numbers + strings + booleans) can lead to weird results:
```javascript
let arr = [10, 20, 30, 1, 4, true, "100"];
let sorted = arr.sort((a, b) => b - a);
console.log(sorted);
```
- `"100" - true` → `100 - 1` → `99`
- `"100A" - true` → `NaN`, so no swap

## 🔍 `some()` Method

### ➤ **Purpose**: Checks if **any element** passes the test.

```javascript
arr1.some((ele) => ele % 2 == 0); // true if any element is even
```

- **Returns**: `true` if **at least one** element satisfies the condition.
- Stops at first match.

---

## 🔍 `every()` Method

### ➤ **Purpose**: Checks if **all elements** pass the test.

```javascript
arr1.every((ele) => ele % 2 == 0); // true only if all elements are even
```

- **Returns**: `true` only if **every** element passes the condition.

## ✅ Method Comparison Summary

| Method     | Purpose                                      | Returns     | Stops When       |
|------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------|------------------|
| `sort()`   | Sorts the array based on custom logic        | Sorted array| -                |
| `some()`   | Checks if **any** element meets condition    | `true/false`| First match      |
| `every()`  | Checks if **all** elements meet condition    | `true/false`| First failure    |

## 💻 From the Code:

### 🧪 `sort()` Example:
```javascript
let arr = [10, 5, 100, 30, 6, 2];
let newArr = arr.sort((a, b) => a - b); // Ascending
console.log(newArr);
```

### 🧪 Descending Sort:
```javascript
let newArr1 = [10, 20, 30, 1, 4, true, "100"];
let descendingSort = newArr1.sort((a, b) => b - a);
console.log(descendingSort);
```

### 🧪 `some()` & `every()`:
```javascript
let arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let value = arr1.some(ele => ele % 2 == 0); // true
let value1 = arr1.every(ele => ele % 2 == 0); // false

console.log(value);  // true
console.log(value1); // false
```

# JavaScript Learning Notes - Episode 43: Higher Order Methods - sort(), some() & every() in Javascript



**Topics Covered:**

* Why higher-order functions are needed for proper sorting of numbers using `sort()`
* `sort()` method with a compare function for ascending order
* Tracing the ascending sort logic
* `sort()` method with a compare function for descending order
* `some()` method (checking if at least one element satisfies a condition)
* `every()` method (checking if all elements satisfy a condition)

---

**👉 00:10 - Why higher order methods for sort method?**

* The default `sort()` method in JavaScript sorts array elements as strings based on their Unicode code points. This can lead to incorrect sorting of numbers because it compares them character by character rather than by their numerical value (e.g., "10" comes before "2").
* To achieve proper numerical sorting (or any custom sorting logic), you need to provide a **compare function** as an argument to the `sort()` method. This compare function is a higher-order function because it is passed as an argument to another function (`sort()`).

**👉 00:35 - `Sort()` Method Example (Ascending Order)**

* To sort numbers in ascending order (from smallest to largest), you pass a compare function `(a, b) => a - b` to the `sort()` method.

```javascript
let arr = [10, 5, 100, 30, 6, 2];

let newArr = arr.sort((a, b) => {
  return a - b;
});

console.log(newArr); // Output: [ 2, 5, 6, 10, 30, 100 ]
```

**👉 01:06 - Ascending Order Example Explanation**

* The compare function `(a, b) => a - b` works as follows:
    * If `a - b` is negative, it means `a` is less than `b`, so `a` is placed before `b`.
    * If `a - b` is positive, it means `a` is greater than `b`, so `b` is placed before `a` (a swap occurs).
    * If `a - b` is zero, it means `a` and `b` are considered equal, and their relative order remains unchanged.

**👉 02:13 - How it sorts in ascending - Tracing**

Let's trace the sorting of `[10, 5, 100, 30, 6, 2]` with `(a, b) => a - b`:

1. **Comparing 10 and 5:** `10 - 5 = 5` (positive), so 5 comes before 10. Array becomes `[5, 10, 100, 30, 6, 2]`.
2. **Comparing 10 and 100:** `10 - 100 = -90` (negative), no swap.
3. **Comparing 100 and 30:** `100 - 30 = 70` (positive), so 30 comes before 100. Array becomes `[5, 10, 30, 100, 6, 2]`.
4. **Comparing 100 and 6:** `100 - 6 = 94` (positive), so 6 comes before 100. Array becomes `[5, 10, 30, 6, 100, 2]`.
5. **Comparing 100 and 2:** `100 - 2 = 98` (positive), so 2 comes before 100. Array becomes `[5, 10, 30, 6, 2, 100]`.
   ... and so on. The `sort()` method uses a specific sorting algorithm (implementation may vary) to repeatedly compare and swap elements until the entire array is sorted according to the compare function.

**Key Logic for Ascending Sort:** `return a - b;`

* If `a` is smaller than `b`, `a - b` is negative (no swap).
* If `a` is larger than `b`, `a - b` is positive (swap `a` and `b`).

**👉 05:37 - Descending Order Example**

* To sort numbers in descending order (from largest to smallest), you pass a compare function `(a, b) => b - a` to the `sort()` method.

```javascript
let arr = [10, 5, 100, 30, 6, 2];

let descendingSort = arr.sort((a, b) => b - a);

console.log(descendingSort); // Output: [ 100, 30, 10, 6, 5, 2 ]
```

**Explanation for Descending Sort:**

* The compare function `(a, b) => b - a` works as follows:
    * If `b - a` is positive, it means `b` is greater than `a`, so `b` is placed before `a` (a swap occurs).
    * If `b - a` is negative, it means `b` is less than `a`, so `a` is placed before `b` (no swap).
    * If `b - a` is zero, their relative order remains unchanged.

**Key Logic for Descending Sort:** `return b - a;`

* If `b` is larger than `a`, `b - a` is positive (swap `a` and `b`).
* If `b` is smaller than `a`, `b - a` is negative (no swap).

**Important Note on Sorting Mixed Data Types:**

The behavior of `sort()` with mixed data types (numbers, strings, booleans) can be unpredictable and is generally not recommended without careful handling in the compare function. The example in the code comment (`let newArr1 = [10,20,30, 1,4, true, "100"];`) illustrates this, and the outcome might vary depending on the JavaScript engine's implementation of the sort algorithm and type coercion rules. It's best to sort arrays with consistent data types or provide a robust compare function that handles different types explicitly.

**👉 11:48 - `Some()` & `Every()` Method Overview**

* `some()` and `every()` are higher-order array methods that test whether some or all elements in the array pass a provided function's test. They return boolean values (`true` or `false`).

**👉 12:34 - `Some()` Method Example**

* The `some()` method tests whether **at least one** element in the array passes the test implemented by the callback function. It returns `true` if it finds an element for which the callback returns a truthy value, and `false` otherwise. It stops iterating as soon as it finds such an element.

```javascript
let arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let value = arr1.some((ele, index, arr) => {
  return ele % 2 == 0; // Check if the element is even
});

console.log(value); // Output: true (because 2 and 4 are even)
```

* The `some()` method iterates through `arr1`. When it encounters `2` (at index 1), the callback `ele % 2 == 0` returns `true`, so `some()` immediately returns `true` and stops iterating.

* **Callback Function Arguments (for `some()` and `every()`):**
    * `ele`: The current element being processed.
    * `index` (optional): The index of the current element.
    * `arr` (optional): The array `some()` (or `every()`) was called upon.

**👉 14:45 - `Every()` Method Example**

* The `every()` method tests whether **all** elements in the array pass the test implemented by the callback function. It returns `true` if the callback returns a truthy value for **every** element, and `false` otherwise. It stops iterating as soon as it finds an element for which the callback returns a falsy value.

```javascript
let value1 = arr1.every((ele, index, arr) => {
  return ele % 2 == 0; // Check if every element is even
});

console.log(value1); // Output: false (because 1, 3, and 5 are odd)
```

* The `every()` method iterates through `arr1`. When it encounters `1` (at index 0), the callback `ele % 2 == 0` returns `false`, so `every()` immediately returns `false` and stops iterating.

**Key Differences between `some()` and `every()`:**

| Method   | Test Condition                       | Return Value | Stops Iteration When |
|----------|--------------------------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| `some()` | At least one element passes the test | `true` or `false` | First `true` is found |
| `every()`| All elements pass the test           | `true` or `false` | First `false` is found |
